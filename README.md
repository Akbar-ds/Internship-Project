## Overview
In this  Internship project, I performed comprehensive data cleaning and analysis using Python to uncover key insights from sales data. I identified important variables, established relationships within the data, and conducted a detailed analysis based on product range and company sales state-wise, considering both sales and quantity. Additionally, I applied time series analysis. The project includes data visualization and statistical techniques to derive meaningful insights that can aid in strategic decision-making.


## Motivation
My motivation for this internship project stems from a strong interest in data science and its applications in real-world business scenarios. I aimed to leverage my skills in Python to clean and analyze sales data, uncovering key variables and trends. By conducting state-wise and time series analysis, I aspired to derive meaningful insights that could drive strategic decision-making and improve sales performance. This project provided an opportunity to enhance my analytical abilities and contribute valuable insights to the company's growth.
